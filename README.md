Moon Pie

by Cullin Moran

This Chef program takes the user's weight (in pounds) as input, and prints their weight on the moon.

See the moon-pie-commented.chef file for comments (that file won't run because Chef doesn't allow comment placement like that).

Chef is an esoteric language in which programs look like recipes.
More info on the language here: http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/chef.html

This program is known to run using the Java Chef-Interpreter by @joostrijneveld :: https://github.com/joostrijneveld/Chef-Interpreter

This program is known NOT to work with Acme::Chef (Perl interpreter).
